            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            Thanks for visiting toggle.me.

            This privacy policy explains the what, how, and why of the personally identifying Information we collect
            when you visit the website located at www.toggle.me (the “Site”) and when you use the Toggle extensions
            and services (“Services”) and includes Personal Information collected via email, SMS, telephone or
            other means. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information. By using or accessing
            the Site or Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are
            consenting to our processing of your information as described below.

            <h3>Information we collect</h3>
            <h4>Browse Extensions</h4>
            No visitor information is ever logged. Period.

            Browsers may show a warning sign because the Toggle extension reads some code snippets from the websites
            you visit. It allows the extension to reveal technologies used on websites you visit.

            <h4>Website</h4>
            If you are a Visitor, Toggle collects information on your use of our Site, such as pages visited, links
            clicked, non-sensitive text entered, and mouse movements, as well as information more commonly collected
            such as the referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider
            (“Usage Data”). Toggle’s purpose in collecting Usage Information is to better understand how Toggle’s
            Visitors use the Site. Toggle does not use the Usage Information to identify its Visitors and does not
            disclose the Usage Information other than under the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.

            As a Visitor, Toggle collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (or
            “IP”) addresses (“Potential PII”). Also, you may choose to interact with the Site that results in your
            providing Personal Information to Toggle, such as giving us your name, email address, user name and
            password when signing up for a free trial of the Services or creating an account to post comments to the
            Toggle blog or social media sites, etc. You should be aware that any information you provide in the
            Toggle blog or social media areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

            We only collect Personal Information that is reasonable or necessary to accomplish the purpose of your
            interaction with Toggle as a Visitor. You may choose not to provide this information but you need to
            understand that as a result, you may not be able to engage in certain activities on the Site. Any Personal
            Information provided by you as a Visitor to the Site will be used only as described in this Privacy Policy
            and Toggle’s Acceptable Use Policy located at our website.

            If you are a Customer of Toggle, when you signed up for the Services, you entered into an agreement with
            Toggle to accept Toggle’s terms of use of the Services, which includes the obligations in this Privacy
            Policy and our Acceptable Use Policy (“Agreement”). As part of your use of the Services, we collect the same
            information as that of a Visitor above and may ask you for additional information such as payment
            information, usage data in relation to the Services and other information we deem relevant for the purpose
            of providing the Services.

            Toggle may use your information and data as agreed to in the Agreement and to:

            Process transactions between you and Toggle.
            Send e-mails about our Site or respond to inquiries.
            Send e-mails and updates about the Toggle Services, including newsletters.
            Provide support for the Toggle Services.
            Enhance or improve user experience, our Site, or Toggle Services.
            Monitor data to ensure that it complies with your contractual obligations to us.
            Perform any other function that we believe in good faith is necessary to protect the security or proper
            functioning of our Site or the Toggle Services.
            With your prior consent, we may post your personal testimonials along with those of other satisfied
            customers on our Site in addition to other endorsements.
            The information we collect from a Customer is disclosed only in accordance with the Agreement and this
            Privacy Policy and the Acceptable Use Policy.

            <h4>Right to Access, Edit, and Remove Your Information</h4>
            You have a right to access personal information we hold about you. Whenever you use our Site or Toggle
            Services, we strive to make sure that the Personal Information is correct. If that information is wrong, we
            give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate
            business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity
            before making any changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate
            technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk
            the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
            residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free,
            except where it would require a disproportionate effort. Because we protect information from accidental or
            malicious destruction, even after information is deleted from the Toggle Services, it may not be
            immediately deleted from Toggle’s servers. To request removal of your Personal Information from our Site,
            Services, blog or social media, contact us at hello [at] toggle.me. In some cases, we may not be able to
            remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

            If a User interacts with one of our Customers and the User seeks to access, or correct, amend, or delete
            inaccurate data or no longer wants to be contacted by one of our Customers, the User should direct its
            inquiry to the Customer because the Customer is the data controller. If the Customer requests Toggle to
            remove the Personal Information, we will respond to their request within 30 days.

            <h4>Disclaimer Google Analytics</h4>
            This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google
            Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyse how
            visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your
            IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers. Google will use this information for the
            purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators
            and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this
            information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
            information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by
            Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however
            please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using
            this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes
            set out above.

            <h4>Security Measures</h4>
            We take measures to enhance the security of our Site and the Toggle Service. These measures include using
            SSL Certificates and two-factor authentication. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized
            access to your password and to your computer. No security measures are perfect and we cannot promise that
            the information about you will remain secure in all circumstances.

            <h4>Do Not Track Signal</h4>
            We treat the data of everyone who comes to our site in accordance with this Privacy Policy, whatever their
            Do Not Track setting.

            <h4>Children</h4>
            Our site is intended for a general audience and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone
            under the age of 13.

            <h4>How Toggle Collects Information?</h4>
            Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and the emails you read and
            can be used to help recognize you when you return to a website, or when you visit other sites. We, or third
            party service providers, may use cookies to, among other things, measure activity, personalize your
            experience, remember your viewing preferences, or track your status or progress when accessing our site. For
            some of these purposes, our cookies may be tied to Personal Information and/or Potential PII. In particular,
            the Toggle Services use first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across
            multiple pages on a single website. These cookies do not track the same user across unrelated domains and,
            as described above, attempts to infer identity across domains is strictly prohibited.

            Local Storage is a standard facility provided by HTML5-compliant browsers used to retain data on your
            computer across visits to the same website. We use local storage as a temporary holding area for user events
            that were observed locally but, due to the timing of a page unload, were unable to be transmitted as part of
            the user session. Return visits to the same website read and transmit events previously stored in local
            storage to complete previously recorded sessions.

            This information may in the aggregate identify a User, however we will not identify a User as they browse
            the web if the User turns off cookies, as explained below.

            Toggle does not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated domains.
            It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site user
            profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.

            <h4>Opting Out</h4>
            If you wish to prevent all websites using the Toggle Services to be able to record an its activity, you
            can opt-out of the Toggle Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells Toggle to turn off
            recording on any site which uses the Toggle Services. The presence of this cookie is required to continue
            opting out, so if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. (We regret that there
            isn't a better way to make your opt-out more permanent, but due to technical reasons, this really is the
            best we can do at present.)

            <h4>Blocking Cookies</h4>
            If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of
            the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off cookies
            may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you
            manually delete cookies, Toggle will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically
            into sessions across pages on the same website.

            <h4>EU Privacy Shield Framework</h4>
            Toggle complies with the EU Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the EU regarding the collection, use,
            and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Toggle has certified that it
            adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security,
            Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any
            conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
            Principles will govern.

            <h4>Changes</h4>
            We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When there are changes to this Privacy Policy, we will
            update this page. The date on the bottom will always indicate when we last made changes. If you are a
            visitor to this Site and disagree with the Privacy Policy, you should leave the Site and/or cancel your
            agreement with Toggle.
